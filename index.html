                <p>Seems like only yesterday
                    Life belong to runaways
                    Nothing here to see, no looking back
                    Every sound monotone
                    Every color monocrome
                    Life begin to fade into the black
                    Such a simple animal
                    Steralized with alcohol
                    I could hardly feel me anymore
                </p>
                <p>Desperate, meaningless
                    All filled up with emptiness
                    Felt like everything was said and done

                    I lay there in the dark, I close my eyes
                    You saved me the day you came alive

                    Still I try to find my way
                    Spending hours, endin' days
                    Burning like a flame behind my eyes
                    Drown in out, drink it in
                    Crown the king of suffering
                    Prisoner, slave 'til in the skies
                    Disappeared the only thing
                    Bittersweet surrendering
                </p>
                <p>
                    Knew that it was time to say goodbye

                    I lay there in the dark and I close my eyes
                    You saved me the day that you came alive
                    The reason you left me to survive
                    You saved me the day you came alive

                    Come alive [x33]

                    I lay there in the dark and I close my eyes
                    You saved me the day that you came alive

                    Come alive [x15]
